#  Swiftful thinking bootcamp

This is the default app.

Following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ntKJdVNBs&list=PLwvDm4VfkdphqETTBf-DdjCoAvhai1QpO&index=2).

## 01. Using XCode

We can create an app using XCode. There are lots of types of projects we can make.

There is a preview emulator built into the IDE (created when preview component is used). You can highlight components in the code and in preview and they will show a highlight effect. 

If you don't know the options for the component, there are plus and sidebar buttons on the top-right which can be used to see what components are available, or view parameters/options for the component.

There if you click on the play button, it will launch the iOS emulator. 

If you double-click on the app object in the left sidebar to change app properties.
